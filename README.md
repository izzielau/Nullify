# Nullify

## Description
This is our Nullify Application! Our app focuses around three socially acceptable (sneezing, coughing, toilet flushing) sounds in restrooms, designed to cover up bowel sounds through the user's choice of the above three noises. Each one varies in length, with sneezing being the shortest at one second and toilet flushing being the longest at three. In addition, the noises serve separate purposesâ€“sneezing is meant for those potentially loud, short releases of gas,
